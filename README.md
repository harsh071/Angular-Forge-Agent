# Webapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.

## Runing the application
Go to environment.development.ts and insert your API key for Gemini \webapp\src\environments\environment.development.ts
This is a simple angular app, docs: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local
run `npm install`
Run `ng serve` for a dev env. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Copying code to see how it works. 
** Copy the code to a seperate screen or window. ** - This is important, because if you paste it in the app itself it will refresh and you will lose the data. 

Copy all three files. 

Go to app.component.html -> paste the html code 

Go to app.component.ts -> paste the ts code 

Go to app.component.css -> paste the css code

- The app should auto refresh and you should be able to see the results.
